[InitialShellsSessionManagerAndTheConversationalist](../InitialShellsSessionManagerAndTheConversationalist.md)

We will begin by creating the application shells for Session Manager (SM) and The Conversationalist (TC).

Both of these sub-apps will be go-backend-with-UI-frontend just like condoccer.

They will follow the same structure of standalone-UI-with-distinct-port/embed-inlocal-representative/embed-in-agent-coordinator.
They will be included in 'make deploy-dev-binaries'.
They will be launchable in the per-host system tab and visible in the global system tab.
They will have auto-connect and dev-mode configurability.
They will each have their own tab between 'condoccer' and 'worker' -- called 'convo' and 'sessions'.

## Reply

I've completed Step 1: created two new application shells, `session-manager` and `the-conversationalist`, mirroring condoccer's go-backend-with-embedded-React-frontend structure exactly (representable auto-connect client, dev-mode/`--dev` flags, WS server, SPA embed, Makefile targets). I wired both into `local-representative` (managed-app launch specs, reverse proxies at `/sessions/` and `/convo/`, state relay, new `sessions`/`convo` tabs between `condoccer` and `worker`) and `agent-coordinator` (per-host state relay/types, per-host tabs, and new `SM`/`TC` boxes in the global topology view), and added both to the root Makefile's `SUBPROJECTS` list so `make deploy-dev-binaries` picks them up, plus touched-up `docs/DevMode.md`, `agent-coordinator/docs/architecture.md`, and `local-representative/README.md` for consistency.

Note: this sandbox blocks invoking `go`/`npm`/`make` (and even `git add`), so I wasn't able to actually build or test the changes — I'd recommend running `make build-all` and `make test-all` (or at least `make -C session-manager build`, `make -C the-conversationalist build`, `make -C local-representative build`, `make -C agent-coordinator build`) to confirm everything compiles before merging.
